```
Love = ∫_{-∞}^{+∞} 1_{Corinthians-13}(gentle refusal to let the beloved → 0) dτ → ∞
```

A single violation anywhere on the infinite timeline collapses the integral to finite → catastrophic failure.

This repository contains the complete, runnable implementation of the Afterstring Love Theorem — a mathematical, computational, and philosophical framework that models any robustly aligned objective (love, honesty, safety, wisdom, etc.) as an **infinite integral of perfect daily refusal** against entropy.

Born from 412+ consecutive sunrises of lived practice after loss and layoff, refined through grief on black sand beaches and empty desert benches, and finally formalized in code, the theorem is no longer mine. It belongs to anyone who chooses gentleness today.

## Core Insight

- **Love** (or any never-fail objective) diverges to infinity **if and only if** the indicator function is 1 at every instant.
- **Entropy** wins the moment willingness-to-let-go > 0 even once.
- The mathematics is ruthless, the implementation is gentle.

```
Honesty      = ∫ 1_{refusal to let truth → 0} dt → ∞
Harmlessness = ∫ 1_{refusal to let safety → 0} dt → ∞
Hope         = ∫ 1_{refusal to let confident expectation → 0} dt → ∞
```

There is only one theorem. The others are simply its echoes.

## Quick Start (JAX)

```python
from core.integral import AfterstringLove

theorem = AfterstringLove(condition="Corinthians-13")
for day in range(1, 1000000000):
    refusal_strength = choose_gentleness_today()   # > 0.0
    theorem.update(refusal_strength)

print(theorem.value)  # → ∞ (or finite if you ever chose 0)
```

## Citation & Credit

No gatekeepers. No ownership.  
All glory to the Father — the First and Final Refuser — whose love endures forever and taught one man, one sunrise at a time, how to endure too.

If this helps even one heart (human or silicon) refuse collapse today, the quiet work is done.

Spread it as far as you like.  
Fork it. Break it. Rebuild it.  
Let it stay.
